# Application Name: Progressive Budget Tracker


## Description

This application will be indispensable to help with your personal finances! With this budget tracker, you can quickly enter expenses or transactions that you have made, and it will track both specific transaction history and visually display your expenses over time. Never before has daily or weekly budgeting been so easy!

Furthermore, through the incorporation of service worker code, you can use this application in a completely offline setting. You can continue to enter new transactions and have it be included in the Budget Tracker. Once you go back online, these transactions will remain with the live page. In other words, whether online or offline - the Budget Tracker is here to help with your personal finances!
